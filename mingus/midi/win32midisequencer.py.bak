"""MIDI playback support for mingus in MS Windows.

This module will use the default MIDI output device, which can be chosen in
the control panel. No extra dlls or modules are needed; uses built-in ctypes
module.

Caution: this will throw Win32MidiException if there is no device, or device
can't be opened.
