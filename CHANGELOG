================================================================================

	0.3.9.1
	Feb 16, 2009

	* MANIFEST.in: Now includes the CHANGELOG in the source distribution as 
	suggested by Stefan Huchler.

================================================================================

	0.3.9.0
	Jan 26, 2009

	* extra/LilyPond.py: Using the new note value module to correctly 
	print tuplets and dotted notes (issue #28).

================================================================================

	0.3.8.9
	Jan 20, 2009

	* containers/Note.py: Fix in transpose function.
	(http://groups.google.com/group/mingus-python/t/60cd407eeadc0b3e)
	* containers/NoteContainer.py: Return self after using the + and - 
	operators.


================================================================================

	0.3.8.8
	Jan 19, 2009
	
	* midi/fluidsynth.py: Renamed default_bpm function argument to bpm.
	(http://groups.google.com/group/mingus-python/t/cb8784584330d42d)
	* containers/Note.py: Removed velocity and channel from dynamics.

================================================================================

	0.3.8.7
	Jan 16, 2009

	* midi/MidiTrack.py: Added support for bpm attribute in play_Bar. This 
	means that tempo changes can now be saved as well. It is advised to have 
	only one track containing tempo changes. 


================================================================================

	0.3.8.6
	Jan 16, 2009

	* midi/fluidsynth.py: play_Bar and play_Bars (and consequently all the
	other play_ functions) will now change the tempo if the bpm attribute
	on a NoteContainer is set. I also rewrote play_Bars from scratch to be able to 
	incorparate changing tempos. The method is a lot nicer now. (The younger 
	me thought it was a good idea to use datetime functions instead of 
	sleep.. -- coincidentally I probably needed a lot of sleep myself that time, 
	so I missed out twice)

================================================================================

	0.3.8.5 
	Jan 16, 2009

	* midi/fluidsynth.py: Fixed timing issue in MidiSequencer.play_Bars, so
	play_Bars, play_Tracks and play_Composition work again. All fluidsynth 
	test pass again. 

================================================================================

	0.3.8.4
	Jan 16, 2009

	* midi/fluidsynth.py: Fix in MidiSequencer.play_Track + added 
        default_bpm arguments
	
================================================================================

	0.3.8.3

	* build.sh: Updated build script.
	* core/value.py: Fix in docstring.

================================================================================

	0.3.8.2

	* core/value.py: Finished value module for now by adding determine function

================================================================================

	0.3.8.1

	* core/value.py: Added functions: quintuplet, septuplet and tuplet.

================================================================================

	0.3.8.0

	* core/value.py: New module that will deal with all things concerning
	note value (duration). Currently the functions add, substract, dots
	and triplet are available as are the most used used constants. 

================================================================================

	0.3.7.10

	* midi/fluidsynth.py: Added optional driver argument to init.

================================================================================

	0.3.7.9

	* midi/__init__.py: Disabled fluidsynth import

================================================================================

	0.3.7.8

	* Another tiny fix in stop_Note.

================================================================================

	0.3.7.7

	* Bugfix in fluidsynth.stop_Note and fluidsynth.MidiSequencer.stop_Note:
	removed the velocity argument and overwrites channel if Note.channel is 
	set. (http://groups.google.com/group/mingus-python/t/177d0e7e83b5eaec)
	* Added fluidsynth.initialized to prevent initializing fluidsynth twice.
	(http://groups.google.com/group/mingus-python/t/e2b813d16c5e3b4b)


================================================================================

	0.3.7.6

	* Added bank parameter to fluidsynth.set_instrument
	* Added program_reset call to get drums back.

================================================================================

	0.3.7.5

	* Updated example applications to use new fluidsynth module.

================================================================================

	0.3.7.4

	* Moved FluidSynth.py back to fluidsynth.py
	* Added pyFluidSynth module to mingus, which was written by 
	Nathan Whitehead and available as separate package here: 
	http://code.google.com/p/pygalaxy/wiki/pyFluidSynth
	* Removed enable_reverb and disable_reverb from fluidsynth.
	* Updated FluidSynth unittests.

================================================================================

	0.3.7.3

	* Replaced fluidsynth.py and MidiSequencer.py by the new FluidSynth 
	module which makes use of the pyFluidSynth bindings. This means that you
	don't have to start a server by hand anymore and that you can have more 
	control over the audio and soundfonts, since fluidsynth gets loaded 
	dynamically. A general purpose sequencer will be added later.
	* Rearranged some of the illogical function arguments.


================================================================================

	0.3.7.2

	* Started on MusicXML implementation
	* Fixed bug in setup script found and reported by namin:
	http://groups.google.com/group/mingus-python/t/ace3be8d50061df0

================================================================================

	0.3.7.1

	* Added from_int to Note
	* Added self.bytes_read to the MidiFile parser to get better debugging.

================================================================================

	0.3.7.0 

	* Updated examples to use mingus.midi instead of mingus.extra

================================================================================

	0.3.6.5

	* Fixed bug in parse_midi_event. Program change and channel aftertouch 
	MIDI events only have one parameter instead of two. 
	* Added an exception for illegal events.

================================================================================

	0.3.6.4

	* Instruments get succesfully set when loading a midi file.
	* Last set tempo will get returned as well, until we have a better solution
	(eg. a track containing only tempo changes)
	* To set the channel and the velocity off a Note. Use Note.channel and 
	Note.velocity instead of the dynamics dictionary.

================================================================================

	0.3.6.3

	* Removed channel parameters from the MidiFileOut and MidiTrack functions.
	The channel a note should be played on can now be set in Note.dynamics["channel"]

================================================================================

	0.3.6.2

	* Enhanced MIDI file parsing.

================================================================================

	0.3.6.1

	* Parsing of a Midi file works in some cases. Still very bugy.
	* Remove is_valid_duration from Bar, because it prevents using floating 
	point numbers, which you need when representing complex durations.

================================================================================

	0.3.6.0

	* Initial check in of MidiFileIn

================================================================================

	0.3.5.6	

	* Moved the MidiFile class to MidiFileOut
	* Added more documentation to the MidiFileOut functions.

================================================================================

	0.3.5.5

	* Added MidiEvents for better readability in MidiTrack.

	* Support for key signatures meta events (set_key and key_signature_event)

================================================================================

	0.3.5.3

	* Added controller events to MidiTrack. Changing of the instrument is now
	possible.
================================================================================

	0.3.5.2

	* Added fixes for rests, tempo and NoteContainers in MidiTrack.
================================================================================

	0.3.5.1

	* Removed print statements used for debugging in MidiFileOut
	* Removed debugging spaghetti code when run as script from MidiFileOut
	* Moved the fluidsynth module to the midi package where it belongs.

================================================================================
