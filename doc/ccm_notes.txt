Note Class:

requires some indication of the sound to play
    pitch and instrument
    percussion instrument (e.g. no pitch)

should be playable by itself (e.g. not as part of a bar)

optional params:
    duration
    velocity
    channel
    bank?
    other params like pitch bend?


Bar Class:
Notes should be able to start in a bar and end in a different bar

a bar can have a meter, or inherit it from a track


Inheritence Precident:

    Some params should be inherited from outer containers, unless they are specified.

    For example, a track, contains a bar contains, a notecontainer contains, a note. If the track has
    a channel, it should pass it to each bar. If a bar has a channel it should use it. But if the bar's
    channel is None, it should inherit it from the track, etc...
