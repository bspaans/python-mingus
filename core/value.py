"""Module for dealing with values.

A note value indicates the relative duration of a note.

In mingus, note values are represented by floating point numbers.
A quarter note is 4, because it stands for 1/4 note, an eighth note is 8
because it stands for 1/8, a sixteenth note is 16, etc.

These are all pretty straight forward, but how do you define a sixteenth
triplet? Well, sixteenth triplets are made by taking an eighth note
and deviding it in 3 equal parts. 1/8 times 1/3 = 1/24; so 24 is the number
we want. How about a dotted eighth note? A dotted eighth note has the length
of an eighth note plus half an eighth note. 1/8 + 1/16 = 3/16 = 1 / 16 / 3.
So 16/3 is the number we are looking for.

As you can see these calculations can be quite tiresome and can clutter
up your code. This module is here to help do the conversion.
